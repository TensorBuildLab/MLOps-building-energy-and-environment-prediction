# Run report: robod-room3-pm25-30min

**Task:** forecast pm2.5 (pm25, ug/m3) 30 min ahead (2 step(s) of 15 min)

## Data check

8352 raw rows from 2021-09-07 00:00:00+08:00 to 2021-12-23 23:55:00+08:00, typical step 5 min.

| Severity | Issue | What we found | What happens / what to do |
|---|---|---|---|
| warning | `index:gaps` | 7 gap(s) longer than 3 time steps, 79 d 35 min in total; longest 68 d 5 min from 2021-10-01 23:55:00+08:00 to 2021-12-09 00:00:00+08:00. | Gaps stay missing. Short gaps in inputs are forward-filled; the target is never filled. |
| info | `columns:undeclared` | 14 column(s) are not declared and will be ignored: ceiling_fan_energy, ahu_fan_energy, cooling_coil_valve_position, cooling_coil_valve_command, ahu_fan_speed, offcoil_air_temp, offcoil_temp_setpoint, pressure_across_filter .... | Declare any you want the model to use. |
| warning | `spikes:air_temperature` | 1 single-sample spike(s), e.g. 26.852 at 2021-09-10 02:15:00+08:00. | prepare() treats them as missing. |
| warning | `spikes:indoor_relative_humidity` | 53 single-sample spike(s), e.g. 69.088, 67.0573, 65.3896 at 2021-09-07 00:15:00+08:00. | prepare() treats them as missing. |
| warning | `stuck:occupant_count` | Sensor repeats exactly 3 for 6 h 5 min (2021-12-16 12:00:00+08:00 to 2021-12-16 18:05:00+08:00); 1 such stretch(es), 6 h 5 min in total. The value is unchanged in 89% of steps and changes by at least ~1 when it does: this looks like change-of-value logging with a deadband. | If so, flat stretches are normal: declare the column with flat_ok=True and note why. Otherwise prepare() treats them as missing. |
| warning | `spikes:dry_bulb_temp` | 11 single-sample spike(s), e.g. 24.6033, 26.9033, 26.0046 at 2021-09-10 05:00:00+08:00. | prepare() treats them as missing. |
| warning | `spikes:outdoor_relative_humidity` | 32 single-sample spike(s), e.g. 83.6001, 84.2, 78.985 at 2021-09-07 07:15:00+08:00. | prepare() treats them as missing. |

**Decisions recorded:**

- Timestamps carry +08:00; converted to Asia/Singapore local time (no daylight saving).
- indoor_co2 never reads below exactly 400 ppm: a sensor floor, so long flat stretches at 400 in an empty room are real. Declared flat_ok so they are not masked as a stuck sensor.
- wifi_connected_devices declared 'other': a proxy for occupancy, not a count of people.
- Energy columns are kWh per 5-minute interval (not cumulative), so declared as interval energy.
- ahu_fan_energy not used: identical statistics in Rooms 4 and 5 suggest a shared AHU, not room-level data.
- Data cover weekdays in separate blocks between September and December 2021; gaps between blocks stay missing.
- outdoor_relative_humidity sits at 99.9-100% for many hours on tropical nights: saturation, not a stuck sensor. Declared flat_ok.

## Validation

| model | type | RMSE | MAE | CV(RMSE) % | NMBE % | R² |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ridge | ml | 2.958 | 0.692 | 81.607 | 7.172 | 0.343 |
| persistence | baseline | 2.990 | 0.674 | 82.512 | 2.283 | 0.329 |
| gbm_change | ml | 3.003 | 0.651 | 82.852 | 2.395 | 0.323 |
| random_forest | ml | 3.187 | 0.685 | 87.934 | 10.119 | 0.237 |
| gbm | ml | 3.280 | 0.749 | 90.498 | 12.955 | 0.192 |
| time_of_day_profile | baseline | 3.661 | 1.110 | 101.023 | 18.772 | -0.006 |

## Test result

Chosen model: **ridge** {'model__alpha': np.float64(19.549524484259873)}

| Metric | Model | persistence |
|---|---|---|
| RMSE (ug/m3) | 0.472 | 0.404 |
| MAE (ug/m3) | 0.325 | 0.211 |
| CV(RMSE) % | 16.445 | 14.079 |
| NMBE % | -4.919 | 0.296 |
| R² | 0.511 | 0.642 |

Skill vs persistence: **-0.17** (1 = perfect, 0 = no better than the baseline).

90% prediction interval: ±0.774 ug/m3 (width from validation errors); it contained 91% of test values.

## Backtest (rolling origin)

The chosen model refitted before each block on all earlier data:

| Block | Rows | Skill |
|---|---|---|
| 2021-12-13 to 2021-12-16 | 279 | 0.01 |
| 2021-12-16 to 2021-12-21 | 278 | -0.08 |
| 2021-12-21 to 2021-12-23 | 278 | -0.32 |

Pooled skill: **0.01**. The first blocks overlap the validation period used to choose the model; the single test period above is the untouched result.

## What the model relies on

Share of the model's accuracy lost when each input is scrambled (test period):

| Input | Share |
|---|---|
| pm2.5 (recent history) | 67% |
| calendar (time of day, weekday) | 10% |
| chilled_water_energy | 6% |
| supply_air_flow | 5% |
| air_temperature | 5% |
| dry_bulb_temp | 4% |
| supply_air_temperature | 1% |
| illuminance | 1% |

> Warning: The model is barely better than persistence on test data (skill -0.17).
