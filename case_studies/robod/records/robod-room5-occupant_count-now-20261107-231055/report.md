**Decisions recorded:**

- Timestamps carry +08:00; converted to Asia/Singapore local time (no daylight saving).
- indoor_co2 never reads below exactly 400 ppm: a sensor floor, so long flat stretches at 400 in an empty room are real. Declared flat_ok so they are not masked as a stuck sensor.
- wifi_connected_devices declared 'other': a proxy for occupancy, not a count of people.
- Energy columns are kWh per 5-minute interval (not cumulative), so declared as interval energy.
- ahu_fan_energy not used: identical statistics in Rooms 4 and 5 suggest a shared AHU, not room-level data.
- Data cover weekdays in separate blocks between September and December 2021; gaps between blocks stay missing.
- outdoor_relative_humidity sits at 99.9-100% for many hours on tropical nights: saturation, not a stuck sensor. Declared flat_ok.
- chilled_water_energy: whole days on which the meter read zero while the AHU fan ran with the cooling-coil valve open are set to missing (dead meter; see mask_dead_chilled_water_meter).
- occupant_presence excluded: it comes from the same camera ground truth as the target, so it would leak the answer.

Time-ordered, with a 0 s gap between sets.

## Validation

## Test result

Chosen model: **gbm** {'min_samples_leaf': 20, 'max_leaf_nodes': 15, 'max_iter': 200, 'learning_rate': 0.05, 'l2_regularization': 0.1}

| Metric | Model | time_of_day_profile |
|---|---|---|
| RMSE (count) | 0.682 | 2.063 |
| MAE (count) | 0.421 | 1.355 |
| CV(RMSE) % | 94.479 | 285.664 |
| NMBE % | -29.692 | -183.473 |
| R² | 0.563 | -2.996 |

Skill vs time_of_day_profile: **0.67** (1 = perfect, 0 = no better than the baseline).

90% prediction interval: ±3.45 count (width from validation errors); it contained 100% of test values.

## Backtest (rolling origin)

The chosen model refitted before each block on all earlier data:

| Block | Rows | Skill |
|---|---|---|
| 2021-11-12 to 2021-12-10 | 452 | 0.12 |
| 2021-12-10 to 2021-12-17 | 451 | 0.71 |
| 2021-12-17 to 2021-12-23 | 451 | 0.64 |

Pooled skill: **0.35**. The first blocks overlap the validation period used to choose the model; the single test period above is the untouched result.

## What the model relies on

Share of the model's accuracy lost when each input is scrambled (test period):

| Input | Share |
|---|---|
| plug_load_energy | 20% |
| supply_air_temperature | 15% |
| calendar (time of day, weekday) | 14% |
| pm2.5 | 9% |
| global_horizontal_solar_radiation | 8% |
| indoor_relative_humidity | 8% |
| wifi_connected_devices | 7% |
| dry_bulb_temp | 7% |
| indoor_co2 | 6% |
| sound_pressure_level | 3% |
