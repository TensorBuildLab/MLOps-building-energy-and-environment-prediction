# Run report: robod-room3-occupant_count-now

**Task:** estimate occupant_count (occupancy_count, count) at the same moment as its inputs (estimation / virtual sensor)

## Data check

8352 raw rows from 2021-09-07 00:00:00+08:00 to 2021-12-23 23:55:00+08:00, typical step 5 min.

| Severity | Issue | What we found | What happens / what to do |
|---|---|---|---|
| warning | `index:gaps` | 7 gap(s) longer than 3 time steps, 79 d 35 min in total; longest 68 d 5 min from 2021-10-01 23:55:00+08:00 to 2021-12-09 00:00:00+08:00. | Gaps stay missing. Short gaps in inputs are forward-filled; the target is never filled. |
| info | `columns:undeclared` | 15 column(s) are not declared and will be ignored: ceiling_fan_energy, ahu_fan_energy, cooling_coil_valve_position, cooling_coil_valve_command, ahu_fan_speed, offcoil_air_temp, offcoil_temp_setpoint, pressure_across_filter .... | Declare any you want the model to use. |
| warning | `spikes:air_temperature` | 1 single-sample spike(s), e.g. 26.852 at 2021-09-10 02:15:00+08:00. | prepare() treats them as missing (by default). |
| warning | `spikes:indoor_relative_humidity` | 53 single-sample spike(s), e.g. 69.088, 67.0573, 65.3896 at 2021-09-07 00:15:00+08:00. | prepare() treats them as missing (by default). |
| warning | `stuck:occupant_count` | Sensor repeats exactly 3 for 6 h 5 min (2021-12-16 12:00:00+08:00 to 2021-12-16 18:05:00+08:00); 1 such stretch(es), 6 h 5 min in total. The value is unchanged in 89% of steps and changes by at least ~1 when it does: this looks like change-of-value logging with a deadband. | If so, flat stretches are normal: declare the column with flat_ok=True and note why. Otherwise prepare() treats them as missing. |
| warning | `missing:chilled_water_energy` | 31% of entries are missing. | Models that need complete inputs fill them with the training median. |
| warning | `spikes:dry_bulb_temp` | 11 single-sample spike(s), e.g. 24.6033, 26.9033, 26.0046 at 2021-09-10 05:00:00+08:00. | prepare() treats them as missing (by default). |
| warning | `spikes:outdoor_relative_humidity` | 32 single-sample spike(s), e.g. 83.6001, 84.2, 78.985 at 2021-09-07 07:15:00+08:00. | prepare() treats them as missing (by default). |

**Decisions recorded:**

- Timestamps carry +08:00; converted to Asia/Singapore local time (no daylight saving).
- indoor_co2 never reads below exactly 400 ppm: a sensor floor, so long flat stretches at 400 in an empty room are real. Declared flat_ok so they are not masked as a stuck sensor.
- wifi_connected_devices declared 'other': a proxy for occupancy, not a count of people.
- Energy columns are kWh per 5-minute interval (not cumulative), so declared as interval energy.
- ahu_fan_energy not used: identical statistics in Rooms 4 and 5 suggest a shared AHU, not room-level data.
- Data cover weekdays in separate blocks between September and December 2021; gaps between blocks stay missing.
- outdoor_relative_humidity sits at 99.9-100% for many hours on tropical nights: saturation, not a stuck sensor. Declared flat_ok.
- chilled_water_energy: whole days on which the meter read zero while the AHU fan ran with the cooling-coil valve open are set to missing (dead meter; see mask_dead_chilled_water_meter).
- occupant_presence excluded: it comes from the same camera ground truth as the target, so it would leak the answer.

## Test result

Chosen model: **gbm** {'min_samples_leaf': 20, 'max_leaf_nodes': 15, 'max_iter': 200, 'learning_rate': 0.05, 'l2_regularization': 0.1}

| Metric | Model | towt |
|---|---|---|
| RMSE (count) | 2.055 | 2.545 |
| MAE (count) | 1.220 | 1.513 |
| CV(RMSE) % | 514.142 | 636.764 |
| NMBE % | -296.093 | -364.561 |
| R² | -4.115 | -6.846 |

Skill vs towt: **0.19** (1 = perfect, 0 = no better than the baseline).

90% prediction interval: ±1.99 count (width from validation errors); it contained 71% of test values.

## Backtest (rolling origin)

The chosen model refitted before each block on all earlier data:

| Block | Rows | Skill |
|---|---|---|
| 2021-12-13 to 2021-12-16 | 279 | 0.24 |
| 2021-12-16 to 2021-12-21 | 279 | 0.18 |
| 2021-12-21 to 2021-12-23 | 278 | 0.34 |

Pooled skill: **0.29**. The first blocks overlap the validation period used to choose the model; the single test period above is the untouched result.

## What the model relies on

Share of the model's accuracy lost when each input is scrambled (test period):

| Input | Share |
|---|---|
| damper_position | 87% |
| lighting_energy | 4% |
| dry_bulb_temp | 3% |
| supply_air_flow | 2% |
| sound_pressure_level | 2% |
| chilled_water_energy | 2% |
