## Data check

13536 raw rows from 2021-09-07 00:00:00+08:00 to 2021-12-23 23:55:00+08:00, typical step 5 min.

| Severity | Issue | What we found | What happens / what to do |
|---|---|---|---|
| warning | `index:gaps` | 11 gap(s) longer than 3 time steps, 61 d 55 min in total; longest 23 d 5 min from 2021-10-01 23:55:00+08:00 to 2021-10-25 00:00:00+08:00. | Gaps stay missing. Short gaps in inputs are forward-filled; the target is never filled. |
| info | `columns:undeclared` | 14 column(s) are not declared and will be ignored: ceiling_fan_energy, ahu_fan_energy, cooling_coil_valve_position, cooling_coil_valve_command, ahu_fan_speed, offcoil_air_temp, offcoil_temp_setpoint, pressure_across_filter .... | Declare any you want the model to use. |
| warning | `spikes:indoor_co2` | 6 single-sample spike(s), e.g. 633.433, 580.433, 543.867 at 2021-09-07 06:55:00+08:00. | prepare() treats them as missing. |
| warning | `spikes:air_temperature` | 169 single-sample spike(s), e.g. 25.9052, 25.7607, 25.876 at 2021-09-07 00:15:00+08:00. | prepare() treats them as missing. |
| warning | `spikes:indoor_relative_humidity` | 52 single-sample spike(s), e.g. 76.6427, 74.8973, 79.3857 at 2021-09-14 00:10:00+08:00. | prepare() treats them as missing. |
| warning | `stuck:occupant_count` | Sensor repeats exactly 1 for 7 h 5 min (2021-09-29 01:25:00+08:00 to 2021-09-29 08:30:00+08:00); 1 such stretch(es), 7 h 5 min in total. The value is unchanged in 78% of steps and changes by at least ~1 when it does: this looks like change-of-value logging with a deadband. | If so, flat stretches are normal: declare the column with flat_ok=True and note why. Otherwise prepare() treats them as missing. |
| warning | `stuck:chilled_water_energy` | Sensor repeats exactly 0.0440593 for 11 h 45 min (2021-11-03 18:40:00+08:00 to 2021-11-04 06:25:00+08:00); 1 such stretch(es), 11 h 45 min in total. | prepare() treats these stretches as missing. |
| warning | `stuck:supply_air_temperature` | Sensor repeats exactly 27.4455 for 6 h 20 min (2021-11-01 00:00:00+08:00 to 2021-11-01 06:20:00+08:00); 1 such stretch(es), 6 h 20 min in total. | prepare() treats these stretches as missing. |
| warning | `stuck:supply_air_flow` | Sensor repeats exactly 739.639 for 1 d 3 h 15 min (2021-11-16 15:25:00+08:00 to 2021-11-17 18:40:00+08:00); 2 such stretch(es), 2 d 3 h 40 min in total. | prepare() treats these stretches as missing. |
| warning | `spikes:dry_bulb_temp` | 21 single-sample spike(s), e.g. 24.6033, 26.9033, 26.0046 at 2021-09-10 05:00:00+08:00. | prepare() treats them as missing. |
| warning | `spikes:outdoor_relative_humidity` | 55 single-sample spike(s), e.g. 83.6001, 84.2, 78.985 at 2021-09-07 07:15:00+08:00. | prepare() treats them as missing. |

**Decisions recorded:**

- Timestamps carry +08:00; converted to Asia/Singapore local time (no daylight saving).
- indoor_co2 never reads below exactly 400 ppm: a sensor floor, so long flat stretches at 400 in an empty room are real. Declared flat_ok so they are not masked as a stuck sensor.
- wifi_connected_devices declared 'other': a proxy for occupancy, not a count of people.
- Energy columns are kWh per 5-minute interval (not cumulative), so declared as interval energy.
- ahu_fan_energy not used: identical statistics in Rooms 4 and 5 suggest a shared AHU, not room-level data.
- Data cover weekdays in separate blocks between September and December 2021; gaps between blocks stay missing.
- outdoor_relative_humidity sits at 99.9-100% for many hours on tropical nights: saturation, not a stuck sensor. Declared flat_ok.

Time-ordered, with a 30 min gap between sets.

## Validation

| model | type | Brier score | Accuracy | Balanced accuracy | F1 | ROC AUC |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| persistence | baseline | 0.034 | 0.957 | 0.956 | 0.961 | 0.972 |
| random_forest | ml | 0.046 | 0.939 | 0.932 | 0.948 | 0.992 |
| gbm | ml | 0.069 | 0.915 | 0.906 | 0.929 | 0.987 |
| logistic | ml | 0.072 | 0.914 | 0.904 | 0.927 | 0.973 |
| same_time_yesterday | baseline | 0.217 | 0.718 | 0.690 | 0.790 | 0.738 |

## Test result

Chosen model: **persistence** 

| Metric | Model | persistence |
|---|---|---|
| Brier score | 0.046 | 0.046 |
| Accuracy | 0.947 | 0.947 |
| Balanced accuracy | 0.944 | 0.944 |
| F1 | 0.955 | 0.955 |
| ROC AUC | 0.958 | 0.958 |

Skill vs persistence: **0.00** (1 = perfect, 0 = no better than the baseline).

## Backtest (rolling origin)

The chosen model refitted before each block on all earlier data:

| Block | Rows | Skill |
|---|---|---|
| 2021-11-12 to 2021-12-10 | 452 | 0.00 |
| 2021-12-10 to 2021-12-17 | 451 | 0.00 |
| 2021-12-17 to 2021-12-23 | 451 | 0.00 |

Pooled skill: **0.00**. The first blocks overlap the validation period used to choose the model; the single test period above is the untouched result.

## What the model relies on

Share of the model's accuracy lost when each input is scrambled (test period):

| Input | Share |
|---|---|
| occupant_presence (recent history) | 100% |

> Warning: No machine-learning model beat the 'persistence' baseline on validation data. Look for better inputs before deploying anything more complex.
